# Content

Post `content` can be a [Text](#text) or an array of "paragraphs". A "paragraph" is either a ["block" element](#block-elements) or ["Inline content"](#inline-content).

## Inline content

"Inline content" is any of:

* A [Text](#text)
* An array of [inline elements](#inline-elements)

## Inline elements

### Text

```js
"Test"
```

### Styled text

```js
{
	type: "text",
	style: "...",
	content: InlineContent
}
```

Styles:

* `"bold"`
* `"italic"`
* `"underlined"`
* `"strikethrough"`
* `"subscript"`
* `"superscript"`

### New line

```js
"\n"
```

### Emoji

```js
{
	type: "emoji",
	name: "...",
	url: "..."
}
```

### Quote (inline)

```js
{
	type: "quote",
	kind: string?,
	content: InlineContent
}
```

* `kind` is for "imageboards" which have regular quotes (`> Text`) and "inverse" quotes (`< Text`).

### Inline spoiler

```js
{
	type: "spoiler",
	censored: boolean?,
	content: InlineContent
}
```

* `censored` is for cases when the app autogenerates an inline spoiler to hide ignored words (like "swear" words).

### Post link

```js
{
	type: "post-link",
	url: "...",
	content: InlineContent
}
```

On "imageboards" the way to quote a post is by writing `>>PostId`. Such quoted post ids can be parsed by the app into `post-link` elements.

Message text example:

```
>>12345
> as said in the document
what document?
```

Parsed content:

```js
[
	{
		type: 'post-link',
		url: '/b/123#12345',
		boardId: 'b',
		threadId: 123,
		postId: 12345,
		content: [{
			type: 'quote',
			content: 'as said in the document'
		}]
	},
	'what document?'
]
```

### Link

```js
{
	type: "link",
	url: "...",
	service: String?,
	attachment: Attachment?,
	content: InlineContent,
	contentGenerated: boolean?
}
```

* `service` is for cases when parsing links. For example, a YouTube video link may have `service` set to `youtube` to show YouTube icon before it.
* `attachment` is for cases when parsing links. For example, a YouTube video link may have both `content` with the title of the video and `attachment` being a [`Video`](#video).
* Sometimes a link is parsed from a URL an in such cases `content` is autogenerated from the URL and `contentGenerated: true` flag is set.

### Code (inline)

```js
{
	type: "code",
	language: String?,
	content: InlineContent
}
```

* `language` can be specified for syntax highlighting.

### Read more (inline)

A "Read more" button that is placed in the same paragraph as the trimmed text. Is autogenerated when generating post previews for long posts.

```js
{
	type: "read-more"
}
```

## Block elements

### Subheading

```js
{
	type: "heading",
	content: InlineContent
}
```

### List

```js
{
	type: "list",
	items: InlineContent[]
}
```

### Code (block)

```js
{
	type: "code",
	language: String?,
	content: InlineContent
}
```

* `language` can be specified for syntax highlighting.

### Quote (block)

```js
{
	type: "quote",
	url: string?,
	source: string?,
	content: InlineContent
}
```

* `source` can be a website name or an author's name.

### Attachment

[Post Attachments](https://github.com/catamphetamine/webapp-frontend/tree/master/src/utility/post/PostAttachments.md) can be embedded in a post.

```js
{
	type: "attachment",
	attachmentId: number
}
```

* `attachmentId` is the `id` of the attachment in `post.attachments`.

### Read more (block)

A "Read more" button that is placed in its own paragraph.

```js
{
	type: "read-more"
}
```
